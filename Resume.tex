\project{Implementation of a MIPS pipelined datapath}{March 2020 - April 2020}{Computer Architecture}
    \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}\vspace{-0.5em}
        \item Conceptualization and implementation of a 5-stage MIPS pipelined processor in verilog.
        \item The pipeline was able to detect and remedy structural, control and data hazards for \emph{sub}, \emph{add}, \emph{or}, \emph{and} and \emph{beq} instructions.
    \end{itemize}

\workex{Team Anant - Student Satellite Team}{March 2018 - Present}{Member and Lead - Electrical Power Subsystem}
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}\vspace{-0.5em}
    \item Wrote \textbf{register level code} for implementing \textbf{I2C} and \textbf{SPI} protocols on the \textbf{MSP430F5529}.
    \item Worked with the Structrual and Thermal Subsystem to make an Antenna Deployment Module.
    \item Developed and implemented a \textbf{filght plan} for the power-system microcontroller.
    \item As the Subsystem lead I undertook various administrative duties and trained new recruits in the basics of microcontroller programming.
\end{itemize}
