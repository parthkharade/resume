Carbon3D is a company in Redwood City which designs and manufactures industry leading resin based 3D printers.
As a embedded software intern, my main project was to develop a firmware update manager for the printer firmware. A printer typically has multiple micro-controllers. When I joined each of these had it's own script to  program/status check the micro-controller firmware. My job was to build a wrapper around these scripts/ potentially modify the scripts themselves to provide a more consistent interface for managing the printer firmware.
I also actively contributed as a working member of the team and was quick to pickup on the workflow and integrate myself with the daily tickets that the team handled. As a part of these activities, I worked on developing application level code and unit tests using the GTest framework for the state-machines of the printer.
